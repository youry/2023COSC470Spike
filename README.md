## Algorithmic Trading and Short-term Forecast for Financial Time Series with Machine Learning Models Data Warehouse

### Introduction
A profitable algorithmic stock trading the algorithm will benefit from a forecasting system that can produce accurate short-term forecasts. You will help to build up short-term forecasting models using machine learning (ML) models. The project aims to develop effective algorithmic trading algorithms based on accurate short-term forecasts for financial time series using machine learning models. 

### To achieve this objective, the project is focused on three sets of activities:
Build a data warehouse that contains the targeted financial time series as well as other time series that are considered useful as input to the machine learning models. Data acquisition, processing, and staging routines required to feed the data warehouse will dynamically be evaluated and developed. A data visualization and business intelligence layer is also built on top of the data warehouse.
A short-term forecasting model based on machine learning will be developed together with external researchers using the various time series data from the data warehouse. Machine learning algorithms such as neural networks, random forecast, support vector regression, XGBoost, and long short-term memory will be evaluated with several performance criteria to identify the most accurate model from a short-term trading perspective.
The stock-value prediction models, after having been evaluated in themselves, should be applied to simple trading strategies and thus measured for the improvement they bring on those strategies.
